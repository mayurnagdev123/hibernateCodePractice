Person has  unidirectional association to Phone
One person has many Phones.We can retrieve this info from the Person object but not from the Phone object.
A join table Person_Phone is auto created by Hibernate that has 2 columns(Person_roll and Phone_Mobile). These columns are foreign keys that
refer to the columns roll and Mobile in Person and Phone table respectively.

Many cars can be owned by one person;
Car table has an additional column created (owner_aadhar) that refers to the primary key(owner_aadhar) of the owner table.

One company has many employees.
This is similar to the Person and Phone case, but specifying a Join Column in the Company class creates an additional column in the 
Employee class rather than creating an entire different table.
@JoinColumn(referencedColumnName="address",name="worksAt")
private List<Employee> employee;
Now this will create a column in the Employee table with name worksAt that will be "reference" the company address as its foreign key
 Since we save Company object in the AddEmployee class, we also will have to retrieve a company object
